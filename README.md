# IP02-Compulsory-Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Restaurants--without-SQLAlchemy
In this toystory, Iâ€™ll be creating **Python functions** that perform a variety of tasks, as explained below.
## Description
**These are Python functions that perform the tasks indicated below.**
  # RESTAURANT REVIEW SYSTEM
This is a simple example of a restaurant review system using Python. The system has three main classes: `Customer`, `Restaurant`, and `Review`. It mimics the basic functionality of a Yelp-style domain where customers can leave reviews for restaurants.

## Classes
### Customer
The __Customer__ class represents an individual who can leave reviews for restaurants.

#### Attributes:

- `given_name`: The given name of the customer.
- `family_name`: The family name of the customer.
- `reviews`: A list of reviews authored by the customer.

#### Methods:
- `given_name()`: Returns the given name of the customer.
- `family_name()`: Returns the family name of the customer.
- `full_name()`: Returns the full name of the customer.
- `all()`: Returns a list of all customer instances.
- `num_reviews()`: Returns the total number of reviews authored by the customer.
- `find_by_name(name)`: Class method that finds the first customer with a given full name.
- `find_all_by_given_name(name)`: Class method that finds all customers with a given given name.
- `add_review(restaurant, rating)`: Adds a new review associated with the customer and a specified restaurant.

### Restaurant
The __Restaurant__ class represents a restaurant that can receive reviews.

#### Attributes:

- `name`: The name of the restaurant.
- `reviews`: A list of reviews for the restaurant.

#### Methods:

- `name()`: Returns the name of the restaurant.
- `reviews()`: Returns a list of all reviews for the restaurant.
- `customers()`: Returns a unique list of customers who have reviewed the restaurant.
- `average_star_rating()`: Returns the average star rating for the restaurant based on its reviews.

### Review
The __Review__ class represents an individual review left by a customer for a specific restaurant.

#### Attributes:
- `customer`: The customer who left the review.
- `restaurant`: The restaurant being reviewed.
- `rating`: The star rating given in the review.

#### Methods:
- `rating()`: Returns the star rating of the review.
- `customer()`: Returns the customer object for the review.
- `restaurant()`: Returns the restaurant object for the review.

## Example Usage
python
Copy code
customer1 = Customer("Philip", "Muhoro")
restaurant1 = Restaurant("Ozone Layers")

### Add a review
customer1.add_review(restaurant1, 4)

### Accessing information
print(customer1.full_name())  # Output: Philip Muhoro
print(customer1.num_reviews())  # Output: 1
print(restaurant1.average_star_rating())  # Output: 2.0
